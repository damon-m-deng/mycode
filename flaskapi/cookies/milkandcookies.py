## Object: export Flask APIs and interacting with cookies
## A cookie is to remember and track data pertaining to a client's usage for better visitor experience and site statistics
## A cookie is stored on a client's computer in the form of a text file

## A Request object contains a cookieâ€™s attribute. It is a dictionary object of all the cookie variables and their corresponding values that a client has transmitted. In addition to that, a cookie also stores its expiry time, path, and domain name of the site.

# In Flask, cookies are set on response object. Use make_response() function to get response object from return value of a view function. After that, use the set_cookie() function of response object to store a cookie.

# Reading back a cookie is easy. The get() method of request.cookies attribute is used to read a cookie.

# On the client side, cookies are typically managed by browsers. However, in this lab, we're going to learn to use curl to interact with the cookies returned by APIs. Before you begin, you should read about how curl manages cookies: https://curl.haxx.se/docs/http-cookies.html
